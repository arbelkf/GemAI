Analysis and forecasting stock prices using different machine learning strategies and parameters:

in this project I have collected closing prices from all the main stocks in the USA for the last 25 years.
I have added related markets indexes and indicators. Than I have run pattern recognitions for this data.
Best predictor was the random forest predictor with the 14 days predictor and sliding window of 3 days. It predicts buying opportunity.
The results are around 33 percent for true positive and true negative. The label is 3 options label â€“ which means that randomly deciding will result also in 33 percent.
